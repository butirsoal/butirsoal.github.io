                                            The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It isnamed after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.Constructed in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair, it was initially criticized bysome of France’s leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but has become a globalcultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower isthe tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world: 6.98 millionpeople ascended it in 2011.[The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010. The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. Itsbase is square, 125 metres (410 ft) on a side. During its construction, the Eiffel Towersurpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world,a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930.Due to the addition of the aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than theChrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast aerials, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct. The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second. The toplevel’s upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground, the highest accessible to the publicin the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to thefirst and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as isthe climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it isusually only accessible by lift. 1. Enlighten the Language Features is used based on the passage!

The Leaning Tower of Pisa or simply the Tower of Pisa is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its unintended tilt to one  side. It.......... Behind the chatedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square after the cathedral and the baptistery. The tower's tilt....... During construction, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt.......... In the decades before the structure..........., and gradually......... 
Until the structure....... (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. 
The height of the tower is 55.86 metres from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m. It's weight.......... At  14,500 metric tons. The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. Prior to restoration work performed between 1990 and 2001,the tower........ At an angle of 5.5 dengrees, but the tower now......... At about 3.99 degrees. This means that the top of the tower.......... Horizontally 3.9 metres from where it would be if the structure were perfectly vertical. 
There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the leaning Tower of Pisa . For many years, the design........... To Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Bonanno Pisano.......

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

                                            When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue’s crown.During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue’s exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can’t wait to return to the city in the future. From which part of the statue did Claire receive spectacular views of the city?The mouthThe crownThe eyesThe nose​</a>

1. See the lights, See the party, The ball gowns, See you make your way through the crowd and say, "Hello", Little did i know, That you were Romeo, You were throwing pebbles, And my Daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet" and i was crying on the staircase, Begging you, "Please don't go", And i said (Lanjutkan)
2. I'm driving around in my car, I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far I'd like to change my point of view, I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you but nothing ever happen, And i wonder, I wonder how, I wonder why, Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky and all that i can see, Is just a yellow lemon tree, (Lanjutkan)
3. It's my first night out with you
Treat me right and buy me shoes
Let me be your fantasy
Play with me
I wanna be your girl
(Wanna be your girl, wanna be your)
Just give some time, I'll be ready
Do my make-up, bathe in my perfume
Quick shower, won't take too long
I'll be done, just sing this song
So, wrap me in plastic and make me shine
We can make a dollhouse, follow your design
Let's build a dog out of sticks and twine
I can call you master, you can call me mine (lanjutkan)

                                               The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
Constructed in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France’s leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower isthe tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world: 6.98 million people ascended it in 2011. [The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010. 
   The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. Its base is square, 125 metres (410 ft) on a side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Due to the addition of the aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast aerials, it is the secondtallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct. 
   The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second. The top level’s upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground, the highest accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is
the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually only accessible by lift.

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

                                            Good morning everyone presents here. I stand before you to deliver a speech on discipline. Jim Rohan has beautifully quoted that discipline is the link between goals and success. Discipline is an act of rules and regulation which we follow from our childhood till the end of our life. A well-disciplined people perform their work in the right way and in a given time.Discipline is something that keeps every person in control. It motivates a person to progress in life. Everybody follow discipline in his/her life in a different form. Although, everyone has his own prospect of discipline. Some person considers it a part of their life and some don’t. The temporary pleasure that gives is not the real pleasure of freedom.Importance and Types of DisciplineWithout discipline, the life of an individual will become dull and inactive. Also, a disciplined individual can control and handle the situation of living in a sophisticated way than those who do not. Besides, if you have a plan and you want to implement it in your life. Then you need discipline. It makes things easy for you to handle. It ultimately brings success to your life.If we talk about the types of discipline, there are two types. The first type is induced discipline and the second one is self-discipline. Induced discipline is something that others impart us or we learn by seeing others. While self- discipline derives from within. We learn it on our own self. Self-discipline needs a lot of motivation and support from others.The Need for DisciplineWe want discipline in almost everywhere in life. So, it is good to practice discipline from the early stages of our life. Self-discipline means different things to different persons. For students, its meaning is different. For an employee its meaning is different. And for children its meaning is different.Furthermore, the meaning of discipline changes with the phases of life and priority. Not everybody can be disciplined because it involves a lot of hard work and dedication. Also, it needs a positive mind and a healthy body. One has to be strict with discipline. So that he or she can successfully complete the road of success.Advantages of DisciplineThe disciple is a staircase by which the person can achieve success. It helps a person to concentrate on his/her goals in life. Also, it does not allow him/her derivate from the goal. Moreover, it brings perfection in a person’s life by training and educating the mind and body of the person. So that he or she can respond to the rules and regulations.If we talk about professional life, then disciplined persons are always getting more opportunities than the undisciplined person. Also, it adds an exceptional element to the personality of the individual. Besides, the individual leaves a positive impact on the mind of people wherever she or he goes.ConclusionIn conclusion, I may say that discipline is one of the key elements of our life. An individual can only be successful if she or he strictly live a healthy and disciplined life. Besides, the discipline also helps us in many ways. It motivates the person around us to be disciplined. Above all, discipline helps the individual to achieve the success that he or she wants in life.find the:opening,content,and closingOpening: backgroundsContent: reasonsClosing: the nice sentences​</a>

                                            tugas bahasa InggrisRead the following text loudly and answer the questions!Tower of LondonThe Tower of London is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078, and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. Early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat, a canal that goes around it. The White Tower's purpose was two-fold. It was used for protection: guarding the king and the queen as well as valuables and holding prisoners. It was also used for national security, especially from intimidating London's citizens.The White Tower is large. Most other buildings in London would have been only one story high. The White Tower is around 90 feet high, and would have been visible for miles. It is also strong. It would have been difficult to attach. The walls are up to 15 feet thick. Its only windows were small and low down and the main door was at the top of a wooden staircase. It is built of stone. Almost all London's houses were built of wood. Some of the stone came by ship from Normandy. It was difficult to build. William I and his son forced the Anglo-Saxons from several counties as well as London to work on the building of the White Tower.Questions:1. Where is the Tower of London located?answer:2.

                                            When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue’s crown.During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue’s exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can’t wait to return to the city in the future.How many people are permitted to climb the statue’s stairs per day? 150400240100​</a>

                            5. The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It isnamed after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.Constructed in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair, it was initially criticized bysome of France’s leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but has become a globalcultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower isthe tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world: 6.98 millionpeople ascended it in 2011.[The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010. The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. Itsbase is square, 125 metres (410 ft) on a side. During its construction, the Eiffel Towersurpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world,a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930.Due to the addition of the aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than theChrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast aerials, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct. The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second. The toplevel’s upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground, the highest accessible to the publicin the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to thefirst and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as isthe climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it isusually only accessible by lift. 1. Enlighten the Language Features is used based on the passage!

                            7. Love story:taylor swift
Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

                            10. When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue’s crown.During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue’s exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can’t wait to return to the city in the future. From which part of the statue did Claire receive spectacular views of the city?The mouthThe crownThe eyesThe nose​</h2><br />

Quick shower, won't take too long
I'll be done, just sing this song
So, wrap me in plastic and make me shine

I can call you master, you can call me mine (lanjutkan)

                            17.    The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
Constructed in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France’s leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower isthe tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world: 6.98 million people ascended it in 2011. [The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010. 
   The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. Its base is square, 125 metres (410 ft) on a side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Due to the addition of the aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast aerials, it is the secondtallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct. 
   The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second. The top level’s upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground, the highest accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is
the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually only accessible by lift.

                            18. Love story:taylor swift
Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

                            22. Good morning everyone presents here. I stand before you to deliver a speech on discipline. Jim Rohan has beautifully quoted that discipline is the link between goals and success. Discipline is an act of rules and regulation which we follow from our childhood till the end of our life. A well-disciplined people perform their work in the right way and in a given time.Discipline is something that keeps every person in control. It motivates a person to progress in life. Everybody follow discipline in his/her life in a different form. Although, everyone has his own prospect of discipline. Some person considers it a part of their life and some don’t. The temporary pleasure that gives is not the real pleasure of freedom.Importance and Types of DisciplineWithout discipline, the life of an individual will become dull and inactive. Also, a disciplined individual can control and handle the situation of living in a sophisticated way than those who do not. Besides, if you have a plan and you want to implement it in your life. Then you need discipline. It makes things easy for you to handle. It ultimately brings success to your life.If we talk about the types of discipline, there are two types. The first type is induced discipline and the second one is self-discipline. Induced discipline is something that others impart us or we learn by seeing others. While self- discipline derives from within. We learn it on our own self. Self-discipline needs a lot of motivation and support from others.The Need for DisciplineWe want discipline in almost everywhere in life. So, it is good to practice discipline from the early stages of our life. Self-discipline means different things to different persons. For students, its meaning is different. For an employee its meaning is different. And for children its meaning is different.Furthermore, the meaning of discipline changes with the phases of life and priority. Not everybody can be disciplined because it involves a lot of hard work and dedication. Also, it needs a positive mind and a healthy body. One has to be strict with discipline. So that he or she can successfully complete the road of success.Advantages of DisciplineThe disciple is a staircase by which the person can achieve success. It helps a person to concentrate on his/her goals in life. Also, it does not allow him/her derivate from the goal. Moreover, it brings perfection in a person’s life by training and educating the mind and body of the person. So that he or she can respond to the rules and regulations.If we talk about professional life, then disciplined persons are always getting more opportunities than the undisciplined person. Also, it adds an exceptional element to the personality of the individual. Besides, the individual leaves a positive impact on the mind of people wherever she or he goes.ConclusionIn conclusion, I may say that discipline is one of the key elements of our life. An individual can only be successful if she or he strictly live a healthy and disciplined life. Besides, the discipline also helps us in many ways. It motivates the person around us to be disciplined. Above all, discipline helps the individual to achieve the success that he or she wants in life.find the:opening,content,and closingOpening: backgroundsContent: reasonsClosing: the nice sentences​</h2><br />

                            32. tugas bahasa InggrisRead the following text loudly and answer the questions!Tower of LondonThe Tower of London is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078, and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. Early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat, a canal that goes around it. The White Tower's purpose was two-fold. It was used for protection: guarding the king and the queen as well as valuables and holding prisoners. It was also used for national security, especially from intimidating London's citizens.The White Tower is large. Most other buildings in London would have been only one story high. The White Tower is around 90 feet high, and would have been visible for miles. It is also strong. It would have been difficult to attach. The walls are up to 15 feet thick. Its only windows were small and low down and the main door was at the top of a wooden staircase. It is built of stone. Almost all London's houses were built of wood. Some of the stone came by ship from Normandy. It was difficult to build. William I and his son forced the Anglo-Saxons from several counties as well as London to work on the building of the White Tower.Questions:1. Where is the Tower of London located?answer:2.

                            33. When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue’s crown.During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue’s exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can’t wait to return to the city in the future.How many people are permitted to climb the statue’s stairs per day? 150400240100​</h2><br />
